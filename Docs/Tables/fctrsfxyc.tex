						\tabnote{The first column for each dependent variable shows the coefficient estimates in regressions of intraday yield changes or exchange rate (FX) returns on target surprises; the second column adds path surprises as a regressor. Target and path surprises are obtained from intraday data, as explained in the main text. Intraday changes are calculated starting 10 minutes before to 20 minutes after a monetary policy announcement. The sample includes all regular monetary policy announcements starting on January 2011 for the exchange rate, on January 2013 for 2- 10- and 30-year yields, and on December 2014 for 5-year yields; the sample ends on \lastobs{} in all cases. Figures are expressed in basis points. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are shown in parentheses. *, **, *** asterisks respectively indicate significance at the 10\%, 5\% and 1\% level.}
